# Personal Portfolio  

This project showcases the work I have done in the past. The webpage is built using a straightforward approach with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

Visitors can explore a variety of projects I have worked on, ranging from programming to design.  

To make the webpage more engaging, I have incorporated interactive elements such as text decorations, background changes, and hover transitions. The design is fully responsive, ensuring that it adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.  

From a design perspective, I aimed to reflect my personality for personal branding. I prefer a clean and fresh aesthetic, which is why I opted for a minimalist style. However, to keep the page lively and fun, I integrated bright colors for highlights.  

For future improvements, I plan to enhance the user interface and add a dedicated skills section. This will allow me to highlight additional skills, such as React and Next.js, that are not currently featured in my project section but are important for visitors to know.
