# Personal Portfolio

This project showcases my personal portfolio, hosting the projects I completed in the fall of 2023. The webpage consists of four main sections: the landing page, an about me section, project highlights, and contact information. Each section has interactive elements. As users scroll, the navigation bar remains visible, enhancing the site's navigability.

To begin, the website opens with a simple landing page featuring a prominent "b" logo, representing my name's initial. A moving arrow at the bottom left prompts users to scroll down for more content. Clicking my name in the navigation bar takes users back to this section.

The next section is the about page, offering a brief introduction about me, outlining my interests. This section has interactive elements, with a hovering effect triggering background images—my own designs—when the cursor visits the about me section.

Following this is the most crucial page, the project highlights. It showcases four projects I worked on during the fall semester of 2023. Each project's images and posters maintain the same themes as the original projects. Interactivity is woven throughout this page: hovering over a project highlights its respective box, indicating the selected project. Additionally, a circle around the cursor labeled "open" suggests that the projects can be accessed via their links. The background color changes to a pinkish hue in this section, evoking a more positive and creative ambiance.

The final part is the contact page, providing links to my email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram. Notably, there's a cute arrow and accompanying text that says "click to copy email." When the email is successfully copied, the text changes to "copied email!" This interaction, though small, adds an element of fun.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with my portfolio. For future improvements, I aim to include more of my personal projects to enrich its content. Also, there needs to be a skills section to display different skills I acquire. I intentionally pursued a simplistic and minimal design, which I believe I've successfully achieved.
